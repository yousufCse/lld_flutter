**Abstraction: is a concepts**
    *Hide complexity, shows relevant features.*
*Abstraction hides unnecessary details form a client, and showing only what is necessary.*
Data Hiding

**Encapsulation: is data hiding**
    *Restricts direct access to data.*
1. Put everyting inside a class
2. Data security from outside of the world



Abstraction = concept/idea
Abstract class = one way to implement abstraction in code

### Lowering complexity
1. Immutability
2. Declarative code
3. Mutable state
4. Inheritance
5. Syntax
6. Collections
7. TDD
